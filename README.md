# Go Fish with a Robot

This project is a terminal-based implementation of the Go Fish card game featuring an AI opponent. It is designed for anyone interested in playing around with AI. This project is being developed to help familiarize myself with AI integrations. The game deals cards, checks for matches, and manages gameplay between the player and the AI, providing a simple yet functional simulation of the Go Fish game.

I had ChatGPT write that description. It seemed fitting given the project. I wrote the preceding two sentences and this current one.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the game logic and AI integration.
- **OpenAI API**: Utilized for the AI opponent's decision-making process.
- **termcolor**: For colorizing the text output in the terminal.
- **prettytable**: For creating readable table displays of the player's and AI's hands.



## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need your own OpenAI API key.
